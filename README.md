> Be the change you wish to see in the world. ~ Mahatma Gandhi


At blindnet we eat our own dogfood. Here we have:
* Our own [Privacy Portal](privacy_portal), using blindnet DevKit
* Our own [Talent Portal](talent_portal) where people can send us their CVs (and later claim their privacy rights)

Feel free to use this as inspiration for integrating privacy features into your own tools. It's easy.

Learn how to do it by reading our [tutorials](https://blindnet.dev/).
