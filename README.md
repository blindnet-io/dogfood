# dogfood
At blindnet we eat our own dogfood. Here we have:
* Our own [Privacy Portal](privacy_portal), using blindnet DevKit
* Our own [Talent Portal](talent_portal) where people can send us their CVs (and later claim their privacy rights)

Feel free to use this as inspiration for integrating privacy features into your own tools. It's easy.
